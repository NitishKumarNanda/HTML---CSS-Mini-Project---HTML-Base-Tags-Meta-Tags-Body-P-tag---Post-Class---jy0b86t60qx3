    <h2>Battle Royale Game</h2>
    <p>
      A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that blends last-man-standing gameplay with the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking "safe area", with the winner being the last player or team alive.

    <h2>Sandbox Game</h2>
    <p>
      The term “sandbox” may be more recognizable from its usage in tech or even as an open-ended mode available within certain games. It’s often associated with player choice, open environments, and non-linear gameplay. The sandbox genre has grown from a small niche to encompass a huge variety of titles.
